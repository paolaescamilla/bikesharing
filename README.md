### Bikesharing Analysis

##Overview of the analysis: 
The following analysis is done with the intention to uncover trends in usage of the city bike service in NYC. It is expected that by unconvering usage and profitability aspects it can support investors to establish the same transportation concept in Des Moins, Iowa.


##Results:
With the information collected, it was identified that:

1. Checkout times for users is no longer than one hour. This graph shows the length of time that a bike is checked out for all riders. The result portrays that a bike is checked out for a period of time no longer than one hour.

2. Checkout Times by Gender. If we give a closer look to the chekout times by gender, we will see that male gender show the highest checkout time when compared to women. This can be attributed to the fact than perhaps this mean of transportation is not perceived as safe for women than for men.

3. Trips by Weekday per Hour. If we look at the bike rides per hour but only during weekdays, the information tells us that the most use of bikes is had in the morning, between 6am to 9am, and in the afternoon, around 5pm to 7pm. The schedule strongly coincides with working hours which is already dictating that this is the means of transportation for employees around the area.

4. Trips by Gender by weekday per hour. When looking at trips by gender by weekday per hour, again we see that for the same ranges of time, in the morning and afternoon, males are the highest users of this transportation. 
Then again, further analysis is recommended to unconver the obstacles that women perceive to not use the bike (security concerns, safety, low female ratio in the area - gender gap).

5. User Trips by Gender by Weekday. While diving deeper in the gender analysis, we uncover that the users are mostly male and are subscribers to the service. This aspect can talk greatly of a sense of loyalty to the service. Additionally, the days with greatest use flow are Thursday and Friday.
It is recommended to expand analysis in order to uncover the reasons why the female population are not as engaged, even when subscribed.

6. Start Station distribution. To provide a greater sense of clarity regarding the users, this graph visualizes the location of the start stations around NYC area. 
It is recommended to further analyze why, even though the stations are conveniently located all around the area, still the female population is not as engaged.

7. End Station distribution. About the end stations, most of them are also located in the NYC area however, it is interesting to notice that a few can be found lower south. This can be an important oportunity for this idea as perhaps additional start stations can be placed around these areas. This highlights that the bike service is truly used as a means of transportation that can be further enhanced with proper business strategy.
